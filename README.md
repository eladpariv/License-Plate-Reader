# License Plate Detector
License Plate Detector is a Python project aimed at detecting and analyzing license plates within images.
It utilizes the power of the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model combined with EasyOCR for 
optical character recognition to achieve accurate and efficient license plate detection and recognition.

Features:
License Plate Detection: Detects license plates within images using the YOLO object detection model.
License Plate Recognition: Utilizes EasyOCR for optical character recognition to extract and analyze the text 
from detected license plates.
Format Compliance Check: Verifies that the extracted license plate text complies with the required format.
Visualization: Visualizes the detected license plates along with the recognized text overlaid on the original images.
